### This is a repository for enhancement of MapQuest from Lab 4.9.2

#### Team (Agile) Members:
* Atabay, FJ Vincent
* De Guzman, Jericko

<br>Option 1: Feature Enhancements - MapQuest</br>
<br>You have on your computer the code from "Integrate a REST API in a Python Application" (lab 4.9.2). Your manager has requested:</br>
* Moving the code from your computer to a collaborative version control system
* Feature enhancements

<br>Your manager has received a request from the marketing department to add new features to the MapQuest API application. You manager has given your team the task of making feature enhancements to this application. These feature enhancements can involve UI changes such as improving the formatting output (with colors, tables, etc.), providing the user with additional options such as data using the metric system or miles, or the type of data you provide to the user. Any other improvements that you think are appropriate will differentiate your work from the work of other teams.</br>

<br>
Your manager would also like a list of other enhancements for a future revision. These are called backlog items. This backlog will be used for Project Activity 4.
</br>

<br>
Note: You will be using the final code from the lab, "Integrate a REST API in a Python Application". In this lab, you used the MapQuest directions API to retrieve JSON data, parsed the data and formatted it for the user.
